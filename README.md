## Usage

To use the SKIN-CANCER-DETECTOR web application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this project repository.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the `CancerDetector.ipynb` notebook and execute it to train the machine learning models.

4. Run the Flask microservice backend by executing the following command:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open a web browser and access the SKIN-CANCER-DETECTOR web application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

6. Using the upload button on the web user interface, upload an image you wish to test for cancer.

7. View the test results on the results page.

## Code Explanation

The SKIN-CANCER-DETECTOR web application is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flask. Here's a breakdown of the different components:

- **JavaScript**: This file handles the interactivity of the web application, including attaching event listeners, updating the user interface on user input.

- **Flask**: The Flask microservice backend is implemented in the `app.py` file. It handles the routing and data requests for the web application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or errors while using the SKIN-CANCER-DETECTOR web application, consider the following:

- Double-check that all the necessary files and folders are present in the correct locations, as described in the folder structure section.

- Ensure that you have Python installed on your system, and the required dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- Verify that the data files are located in the `datasets` folder.

- If you encounter any issues with the machine learning models, make sure you have successfully preprocessed the data and trained the models using the provided Jupyter Notebook files (`CancerDetector.ipynb`).

- If the Flask microservice backend fails to run, check that there are no errors in the `app.py` file and that the required dependencies are installed.

If the problem persists, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository for further assistance.
